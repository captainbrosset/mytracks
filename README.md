# My Track sample PWA

This is a sample app to demonstrate various PWA features.

## Enable some features first

Most of the PWA features demonstrated here are still experimental, so before using the app, you will need to enable these flags in Edge or Chrome in `about://flags`

* `#file-handling-api`
* `#enable-desktop-pwas-protocol-handling`
* `#enable-desktop-pwas-window-controls-overlay`
* `#enable-desktop-pwas-url-handling`

## Build the app locally

* `npm install`
* `npx webpack`
